                        Here is how to play the game: You are farming for guns by playing a trivia game. There
                        are three game modes: Borderlands 1, Borderlands 2, and Borderlands 3. Once you select your game
                        you will have 180 seconds to complete the Game and a 5 second time out in between each question once you've made a selection.
